# Incorrect $inc Usage in MongoDB Update Query

This example demonstrates an incorrect usage of the `$inc` operator in a MongoDB update query. The `$inc` operator is used to increment a numeric field by a specified value.  However, this example attempts to increment a field using a string value, resulting in an error or unexpected behavior.

The solution shows how to correctly use `$inc` with a numeric value to increment the field as intended.
